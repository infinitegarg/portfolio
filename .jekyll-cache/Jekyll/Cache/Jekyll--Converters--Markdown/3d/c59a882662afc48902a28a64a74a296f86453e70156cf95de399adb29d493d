Its been almost 3 years since I joined my current startup, Innovaccer, as a Product Designer.
  I was expecting to work on UX research, creating prototypes and mockups, interacting with customers and getting feedbacks, planning marketing etc in a fast paced environment.
But has it ever happened to you that things go as planned ?

I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt and I got to work on a hell lot of things.
  
  Being a Computer Science graduate, I had a background in web development. Also, my curiosity of learning new things had me introduced to a lot more techs. All thanks to the Computer Society, I was a part of, in the college.

Eventually, I worked unofficially at different roles. I‚Äôll try to jot down my learnings while performing those roles.

&lt;div class="section-heading"&gt;Frontend Developer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things are being said for designers who code. I believe it is an added advantage since it lets you do a very different kind of research before designing. Things such as feasibility, tech challenges, scalability, code reusability etc. become a part of design thinking which helps in the development life cycle and making the product a success.
  &lt;br&gt;
  As a designer, I‚Äôm always keen on providing pixel perfect UIs as per the design including all the functionalities to provide the user a better experience. I worked on different kinds of projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Landing Pages - (you know those pages you land on when you click a link in the mail !). These were majorly design rich static pages with minimal interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responsive HTML Email Templates - I learnt to use INKY by Foundation for Emails that helped create templates real quick. These templates were for different purposes like newsletters, customer emails, daily data updates etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Webapps - These were functionality rich applications with integration to backend using RESTful APIs. I learnt a lot while doing these - maintaining UI states, using directives, controllers and other features of Angular Js.
    &lt;br&gt;
    I was part of two projects - A webapp to compare hospitals in US and other to create User Management in an existing product with Access control logic for permissions.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="no-style"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Techs known before this: Foundation 6, jQuery, SaaS, Git, RESTful APIs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Techs which I learnt: &lt;strong&gt;Angular JS, Google App Engine, Gulp, Bower, npm, browserSync, Foundation for Emails, SVG animation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;div class="section-heading"&gt;Backend Developer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the college, I started backend with php but I never liked it. That was the end of backend development for me, I thought. But things had to go other ways, remember ‚Äúthings never go as planned.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was given a task to create a small webapp to monitor the productive hours of employees at our startup. This involved integrating google authentication and creating APIs for the frontend to save the data in MongoDB.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun Fact: Remember the infamous &lt;strong&gt;MongoDB ransomware attack&lt;/strong&gt; ? Incidentally, it happened to be after a week of my learning mongoDB and I insisted on our engineers to have an auth on the api endpoints as they were public prior to it. Saved the day. Pat on the back.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="no-style"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Techs known before this: php&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Techs which I learnt: &lt;strong&gt;python basics, mongoDB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;div class="section-heading"&gt;Motion Graphic Designer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static Illustrations never gave me a feeling of satisfaction. They somehow lack in providing the feel and information. Also, an application without UI micro-interactions is like a song without any music. I started my journey with VFX during college. Yes i was obsessed with Hollywood !
  &lt;br&gt;
  Here I created small UI interactions for the developers and motion graphics for the website.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="no-style"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Techs known before this: After Effects, CSS Animation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Techs which I learnt: &lt;strong&gt;Airbnb‚Äôs Lottie, SVG Animation, Invision Studio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="section-heading"&gt;Product Designer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-2"&gt;Well, I was hired as one so obviously I was responsible for
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gathering requirements from the PMs, stakeholders, customers etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brainstorming and creating sketches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating user personas, user journeys with behavioural traits, empathy maps, mood boards, information system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maintaining design library&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating mockups and prototyping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gathering feedback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning marketing and business with the stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="no-style"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Techs known before this: Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Techs which I learnt: &lt;strong&gt;Invision, Zeplin, Abstract, Invision Studio, Framer, draw.io&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this helped me improve my skills and made me have a better understanding of the product development journey at each step. This allows me to communicate better with my teammates, have empathy towards them and create awesome user experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
