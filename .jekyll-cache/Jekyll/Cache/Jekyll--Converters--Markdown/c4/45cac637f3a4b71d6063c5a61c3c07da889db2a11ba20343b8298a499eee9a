I"å	<p>From joining as an individual contributor at Innovaccer to eventually nurturing a team of enthusiastic designers and design managers, it has been a fruitful learning curve. 
Like every other designer, my love of craft runs deep but as a leader, I had to put aside my designer shoes and help provide vision to the team.</p>

<p><strong>Validating the problems:</strong>  Always ensure thereâ€™s a demand for the problem before supplying any solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Stories donâ€™t just flow around users:</strong> The act of creating a product story before you begin the design process not only helps you mobilize your teams, it also forces you to clarify your intentions for your product. Youâ€™ll step out of the makerâ€™s mindset and consider how your product will fit into the lives of others.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing business to the table:</strong> It was no longer a point of fostering delightful user experiences but also highlighting the business impact.</p>

<p><strong>Making way for exchanging feedback:</strong> Feedback should flow both ways. As a leader, one must ask for feedback on how they can help the designer be their best version. Whatâ€™s working and whatâ€™s not. As designers get in the habit of presenting their work and giving feedback to others, theyâ€™ll learn to think more clearly about their design decisions and become comfortable articulating their ideas</p>

<p><strong>Knowing your team:</strong> 1:1 is never just about understanding the professional capacity of a person but also their personal life. This helps build a great rapport with the team and helps understand lifeâ€™s complexities, which can impact oneâ€™s indulgence in work.</p>

<p><strong>Gratitude:</strong> Take time out of your busy schedule to recognize folks for their contribution often. â€˜Thank youâ€™ is a tiny phrase and goes a long way.</p>

<p><strong>Getting the right design feedback:</strong> Pixel-perfect comps may lead others to believe the work is finished, which will inhibit feedback. Work thatâ€™s a little lower fidelity or with notes scribbled on it will make it clear to all that youâ€™re still working through ideas. Never use a design review as a big reveal of a project. If you wait until you have everything polished, youâ€™ll be too invested to accept the feedback youâ€™re given.</p>

<p><strong>Taking a look back:</strong> Retrospective survey after pushing a feature. This will help reflect on what went well and what didnâ€™t. A survey is a good way to avoid the effect of crowd walking</p>
