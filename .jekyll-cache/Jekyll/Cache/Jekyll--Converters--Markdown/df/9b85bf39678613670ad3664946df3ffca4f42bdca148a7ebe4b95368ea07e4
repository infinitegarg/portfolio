<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Care Managers help patients in their care journey by interacting with them using personalized protocols based on conditions or events (like hospital discharge). This helps to keep a check on the patientâ€™s health and allows tracking for the health systems to take the right path.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>

<p>While care managers are completing tasks in the care protocols, they need to access to the patientâ€™s clinical and personal details quite frequently. This leads to them switching tabs and losing the context of the task at hand.</p>

<h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3>

<h4 id="data-collection">Data collection</h4>
<p>It started with leading a series of workshops and customer/SME interviews to gather insights on the data points that are most important to see while working on different protocols. Those were then clubbed together to consume more efficiently.</p>

<h4 id="stakeholder-management">Stakeholder Management</h4>
<p>Given this was an extension to another product handled by a different team, expectations were managed to build a framework on top of it and identify challenges like responsiveness, page load time, database sync etc.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="success-metrics">Success Metrics</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Decrease in avg. time spent on care protocols</li>
  <li>Increase in frequent actions like changing contact details via the sidepanel</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="usability-testing">Usability Testing</h4>
<p>A series of task-oriented interviews were conducted to validate feature efficiency and adoption. The results were quite promising along with a few suggestions about how and what information weâ€™re displaying.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="designing-for-scale">Designing for scale</h4>
<p>We identified a set of standard cards which can be tailor-fitted into existing patient journeys to provide the right information at the right time.</p>

<p>Also, the idea was to build a framework that have numerous potential integration with the entire product suite. The designers and developers could easily create new cards following a guideline as per their use-cases. Eventually, it was also adopted by our other products like InRef, InReport, Contact Center etc.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>avg. time spent on care protocols <strong>reduced by 75%</strong></li>
  <li>events of updating demographic details of patients via sidepanel <strong>increased by 40%</strong></li>
</ul>
