I"*<p>From joining as an individual contributor at Innovaccer to eventually nurturing a team of enthusiastic designers and design managers, it has been a fruitful learning curve. I perceived myself as someone who had a pretty good understanding of the products I worked upon but leading a team was a whole new territory with its own challenges.</p>

<p>Like every other designer, my love of craft runs deep but as a leader, I had to put aside my designer shoes and help provide vision to the team.</p>

<p>Having the right conversation with the stakeholders</p>

<p>It was no longer a point of fostering delightful user experiences but also highlighting the business impact.</p>

<p>Feedback should flow both ways. As a leader, one must ask for feedback on how they can help the designer be their best version. What’s working and what’s not.</p>

<p>1:1 is never just about understanding the professional capacity of a person but also their personal life. This helps build a great rapport with the team and help understand life’s complexities, which can impact one’s indulgence in work.</p>

<p>Take time out of the busy schedule (and trust me it’s really hard to find time on your calendar) to recognize folks for their contribution often. ‘Thank you’ is a tiny phrase and everyone wants to hear it for their efforts.</p>

<p><em>“As designers get in the habit of presenting their work and giving feedback to others, they’ll learn to think more clearly about their design decisions, and become comfortable articulating their ideas”</em></p>

<p>“<em>Pixel-perfect comps may lead others to believe the work is finished, which will inhibit feedback. Work that’s a little lower fidelity or with notes scribbled on it will make it clear to all that you’re still working through ideas</em>.”</p>

<p>“Never use a design review as a big reveal of a project. If you wait until you have everything polished, you’ll  be too invested to accept the feedback you’re given.”</p>

<p>Retrospective survey after pushing a feature. This will help reflect on what went well and what didn’t. A survey is a good way to avoid the effect of crowd walking</p>

<p>“No need for an agenda—just get to know each other. Spend time with researchers who have their finger on the pulse of your customers, salespeople who hear frequent requests, product managers who understand schedules and scope, and customer service agents who know where users struggle the most. All have valuable context to offer you and your team. Each one influences the success of your team’s work”</p>

<p>now try my best to always ensure there’s a demand for the problem before supplying any solutions</p>

<p>“The act of creating a product story before you begin the design process not only helps you mobilize your teams, it also forces you to clarify your intentions for your product. You’ll step out of the maker’s mindset and consider how your product will fit into the lives of others.”</p>

<p>Designers are not the only people in an organization who understand users—or at least they shouldn’t be.</p>
