<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>I led the creation of an onboarding framework to help better the adoption and engagement of our product features. One may create the most powerful features but they may not hold any value if the users donâ€™t encounter them.</p>

<p>In the consumer world, one can easily switch from one app to other if they arenâ€™t getting the right experience. However, in the B2B world, an average user may not have the CHOICE of the software they work upon.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>So, why would you invest so much in trying to engage a user if they donâ€™t even have a choice for the contract period?</p>

<p>The answer is <strong>customer success.</strong> It bears a great responsibility on the creators of B2B software to make usersâ€™ work simple and fun, if they want their customers to be successful.</p>

<p>Though the title of the post may sound otherwise, onboarding on a B2B software is no different from a B2C one. There are some important factors that one should consider</p>
<ul>
  <li>training</li>
  <li>contextual self-help documentation</li>
  <li>longer journey of customer success</li>
  <li>in-direct relation with user retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The best onboarding is one where the focus is on <strong>making the user successful</strong> rather completing the journey business cares about.</p>

<p>One of the key differentiators for a B2B user is retention in the short-term primarily because of the lack of CHOICE. Hence, we focused on how they can engage and explore more on the product to become a <strong>delightful returning user</strong> rather than someone who logs in just to do their daily job.</p>

<p><br />
With this ideology, we created the onboarding framework</p>

<p>Either the users might be transitioning from other products or getting introduced for the very first time on their work. In both cases, itâ€™s a great practise to involve the users even before the training  kicks in. Let them know whatâ€™s in the box for them, look for building a communities.</p>

<h4 id="enable"><strong>E</strong>nable</h4>

<p>As they start off, the very first thing is to make them heroes by giving them a small win. Gradually unlock their superpowers to achieve more success in their work, because thatâ€™s what their organization has hired the product for.</p>

<h4 id="explore"><strong>E</strong>xplore</h4>

<p>Itâ€™s hard to bring a change in userâ€™s behavioural patterns as they get accustomed to a certain way of achieving things. Itâ€™s important to help them explore features for giving them more success, as we evolve the product.</p>

<h4 id="device"><strong>D</strong>evice</h4>

<p>One of the most important aspects of B2B products is to device the user for their own help. Quick contextual educational content and support is a must whenever they get stuck</p>
