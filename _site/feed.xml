<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Measures help us know if the performance of the health system overall is good and if it is getting better or worse over time. They are standards for measuring the performance of healthcare providers for the care of patients including important aspects like safety, effectiveness, timeliness, and fairness.</p>

<p>CMS (the central body for US Healthcare) has defined and benchmarked various measures to calculate this performance and maintain a quality-cost equilibrium.
A simple example could be - the percentage of patients 18-85 years of age who had a diagnosis of high blood pressure and whose blood pressure (BP) was adequately controlled (&lt; 140/90 mmHg) during the measurement period.</p>

<p>For the system to be able to use this definition, it needs to be translated into a <strong>logical expression</strong> that effectively pours out the performance percentage (%) using data points from various sources.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="breaking-down-the-challenges">Breaking down the challenges</h3>

<p>Not only the user pain points but technical challenges were an equal part of the understanding of what’s happening on the ground. With a series of user interviews and deep-dive sessions with developers following were identified</p>

<ul>
  <li>browser often crashing while creating measure definitions due to DOM load</li>
  <li>difficulty to parse the entire expression for referencing an existing operand</li>
  <li>a lot of scrolling to verify the entire definition as it goes multi-folds</li>
  <li>inability to add custom sections, parameters as that required hard-coding on the backend</li>
  <li>loss of progress due to session timeout or when switching to another task</li>
  <li>no way of validating if the expression was correct</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the problem</h3>

<p>As the measure definitions are getting complex adding numerous data points and relationships,
the user wants to translate simple English into logical expressions visually,
without the system crashing or losing progress</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="connecting-the-dots">Connecting the dots</h3>

<p>Mapping the journey of the data analyst right from receiving a measure definition in plain text, to taking it on a roll for testing the outcome was really important. Few of the patterns identified were</p>

<ul>
  <li>meta information was added on the go while creating/updating operands</li>
  <li>new branches of logic were added in existing branches (say, a new AND expression was added in an existing close-bracketed expression)</li>
  <li>re-using existing operands was becoming more frequent as the definitions were getting complex</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="after-multiple-iterations">After multiple iterations..</h3>

<p>It was one of the most challenging problems that I had encountered that involved a deeper understanding of how the browser DOM functions and how can we work within those limits. Thanks to the dev team for my never-ending list of questions, we finally narrowed it down to the text-editor-based approach.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/img/measure-builder.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/img/measure-builder.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">contextual patient 360° data to help make quicker decisions</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2021/09/13/dynamic-360.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="contextual patient 360° data to help make quicker decisions" /><published>2021-09-13T22:13:07+05:30</published><updated>2021-09-13T22:13:07+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2021/09/13/dynamic-360</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2021/09/13/dynamic-360.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/img/dp360/post-dynamic-360.png" alt="image tooltip here" />

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Care Managers help patients in their care journey by interacting with them using personalized protocols based on conditions or events (like hospital discharge). This helps to keep a check on the patient’s health and allows tracking for the health systems to take the right path.</p>

<p>While care managers are completing tasks in the care protocols, they need access to the patient’s clinical and personal details quite frequently. This leads to them switching tabs and losing the context of the task at hand.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="getting-the-right-data">Getting the right data</h3>
<p>It started with leading a series of workshops and customer/SME interviews to gather insights on the data points that are most important to see while working on different protocols. Those were then clubbed together to consume more efficiently.</p>

<h3 id="playing-nice-in-the-sandbox">Playing nice in the sandbox</h3>
<p>Given this was an extension to another product handled by a different team, expectations were managed to build a framework on top of it and identify challenges like responsiveness, page load time, database sync etc.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="impressions-of-the-initial-set-of-users">Impressions of the initial set of users?</h3>
<p>A series of task-oriented interviews were conducted to validate feature efficiency and adoption. The results were quite promising along with a few suggestions about how and what information we’re displaying.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="designing-for-scale">Designing for scale</h3>
<p>We identified a set of standard cards which can be tailor-fitted into existing patient journeys to provide the right information at the right time.</p>

<p>Also, the most interesting part of the idea was to <strong>build a framework</strong> that have numerous potential integration with the entire product suite. The designers and developers could then easily create new cards following a guideline as per their use-cases. Eventually, it was also adopted by our other products like InRef, InReport, Contact Center etc.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>avg. time to find relevant data <strong>reduced by 75%</strong></li>
  <li>events of updating demographic details of patients via sidepanel <strong>increased by 40%</strong></li>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>I led the creation of an onboarding framework to help better the adoption and engagement of our product features. One may create the most powerful features but they may not hold any value if the users don’t encounter them.</p>

<p>In the consumer world, one can easily switch from one app to other if they aren’t getting the right experience. However, in the B2B world, an average user may not have the CHOICE of the software they work upon.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="onboarding-for-a-b2b-product-isnt-training-enough">Onboarding for a B2B product! Isn’t training enough?</h3>

<p>So, why would you invest so much in trying to engage a user if they don’t even have a choice for the contract period?</p>

<p>The answer is <strong>customer success.</strong> It bears a great responsibility on the creators of B2B software to make users’ work simple and fun, if they want their customers to be successful.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="doesnt-b2c-onboarding-work-the-same-way">Doesn’t B2C onboarding work the same way?</h3>

<p>Though the title of the post may sound otherwise, onboarding on a B2B software is no different from a B2C one. There are some important factors that one should consider</p>
<ul>
  <li>training</li>
  <li>contextual self-help documentation</li>
  <li>longer journey of customer success</li>
  <li>in-direct relation with user retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The best onboarding is the one where focus is on <strong>making the user successful</strong> rather completing the journey business cares about.</p>

<p>One of the key differentiators for a B2B user is retention in the short-term primarily because of the lack of CHOICE. Hence, we focused on how they can engage and explore more on the product to become a <strong>delightful returning user</strong> rather than someone who logs in just to do their daily job.</p>

<p><br />
<br />
Keeping this ideology, we created the onboarding framework</p>
<h3 id="heed-meaning-pay-attention-to"><strong>H.E.E.D</strong> <em>(meaning: pay attention to)</em></h3>
<p><br />
<img class="post-image" src="/img/onboarding-heed.png" /></p>

<h3 id="hype"><strong>H</strong>ype</h3>

<p>Either the users might be transitioning from other products or getting introduced for the very first time on their work. In both cases, it’s a great practise to involve the users even before the training  kicks in. Let them know what’s in the box for them, look for building a communities.</p>

<h3 id="enable"><strong>E</strong>nable</h3>

<p>As they start off, the very first thing is to make them heroes by giving them a small win. Gradually unlock their superpowers to achieve more success in their work, because that’s what their organization has hired the product for.</p>

<h3 id="explore"><strong>E</strong>xplore</h3>

<p>It’s hard to bring a change in user’s behavioural patterns as they get accustomed to a certain way of achieving things. It’s important to help them explore features for giving them more success, as we evolve the product.</p>

<h3 id="device"><strong>D</strong>evice</h3>

<p>One of the most important aspects of B2B products is to device the user for their own help. Quick contextual educational content and support is a must whenever they get stuck</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summary]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/img/onboarding-framework.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/img/onboarding-framework.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
