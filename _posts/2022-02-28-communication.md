### Summary
The Covid-19 pandemic has taught us how important patient communication is, outside of clinical encounters. Using contextual information about the patient in their care journey, providers can build better relationships with them and drive clinical outcomes. Leveraging data, automation, and maintaining a fuller, more complete view of the patient context can help care activities, messaging, and delivery of content.

Design can help visualize the various encounters and important events outside of the clinical setting to stratify and engage better with the patients across channels. 
These initiatives also help better understand the patientâ€™s satisfaction, experience, and engagement in quantitative terms.
